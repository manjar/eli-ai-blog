Quick intro: I spent 17 amazing years creating music software at Apple. Now I'm fascinated by the creative possibilities of AI. This blog will track my learning plan, projects, and what I ship.

**Projects so far**
- Fallacy Detector iOS app (on-device LLMs)
- Kaggle Titanic
- RL checkers agent (lessons learned!)
- Raspberry Pi pet-deterrent (CV + actuation)

**Whatâ€™s next**
- Course: Generative AI with LLMs
- Weekly checkpoint quiz posts
- Deep dives on failures & design choices

**My Apple software I worked on**
- Music Memos
- Voice Memos
- Logic Pro for iPad
- GarageBand for iOS
- and more!
